<p>In this note, we will look at two theorems that formalize properties you are likely already aware of. These properties will allow us to explore the relationship between the degree of a polynomial and the number of roots it has.</p>
<p>Before we look at these theorems, we need to look at another idea – the division of polynomials. As you will see, there are many parallels between polynomial division and regular integer division.</p>
<br>
<a name='divisionalgo'>
<h2>Division Algorithm for Polynomials</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<p>Recall the division algorithm for integers, which said that given some dividend $n$ and divisor $d$, it is always possible to write $n = d q + r$, where $q$ is the quotient and $r$ is the remainder, with $r &lt; d$.</p>
<p>What if we want to divide some polynomial $p(x)$ by some other polynomial $d(x)$? Well, essentially the same statement holds: if $p(x), d(x)$ are polynomials such that $\text{deg}(p(x))\geq \text{deg}(d(x))$, then it is possible to find polynomials $q(x), r(x)$ such that</p>
<div align=center>
<p>$p(x) = d(x)q(x) + r(x)$</p>
<p>where $\text{deg}(q(x)) = \text{deg}(p(x)) - \text{deg}(d(x))$ and $\text{deg}(r(x)) &lt; \text{deg}(d(x))$</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>$d(x)$ is the divisor, $q(x)$ is the quotient and $r(x)$ is the remainder. For simplicity’s sake, we will almost always only look at linear divisors; that is, $d(x)$ will usually be of the form $x - a$ or $cx - a$.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to show the division of $p(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$ by $d(x) = x - 1$. It turns out the corresponding quotient is $q(x) = x - 4$ and remainder is $r(x) = 2$:</p>
<div align=center> $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-1)(x-4) + 2$ </div> <br>
<p>The question is, how did we find that value of $q(x)$ and $r(x)$? While some of the theorems presented later in this article may ease the process, the way to do this in general for any (valid) degrees of $p(x)$ and $d(x)$ is through <strong>polynomial division</strong>.</p>
<br>
<a name='polydiv'>
<h2>Polynomial Division</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<p>There are two ways we can divide one polynomial by another.</p>
<a name='longdiv'>
<h3>Polynomial Long Division</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<p>Polynomial long division is directly analagous to regular long division. Let’s jump into an example - we’ll divide $p(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$ by $d(x) = x - 7$:</p>
<div align=center>
<img src='polydiv1.png' width='200'>
</div>
<br>
<p>As we do in integer long division, we iteratively multiply across and subtract downwards, until we are left with a remainder. We know that our remainder has to be a constant, as our divisor has degree 1 and the remainder’s degree must be strictly less than the divisor’s degree, so that’s when we know when to stop.</p>
<p>Using the quotient and remainder we obtain from above, we can format our division using the division algorithm: $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-7)(x+2) + 20$.</p>
<br>
<p>Now, we’ll look at a higher degree example. Let $p(x) = 4x^4 - 10x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 9$ and $d(x) = 2x^2 + 10x + 3$.</p>
<div align=center>
<img src='polydiv2.png' width='400'>
</div>
<br>
<p>Again, this tells us that we can write $4x^4 - 10x^3 + 7x^2 - 11x - 9 = (2x^2 + 10x + 3)(2x^2 - 15x + \frac{151}{2}) - 721x - \frac{471}{2}$. Here, while $r(x)$ is not a constant (it is the linear polynomial $-721x - \frac{471}{2}$), its degree is still less than the degree of $d(x)$.
<br></p>
<p>As with many things in this course, it’ll be very difficult to understand how to do polynomial division just by looking at this one example. Practice will be key here.</p>
<br>
<a name='syntheticdiv'>
<h3>Synthetic Division</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<p>Synthetic division is a short-form way of performing polynomial long division. While it can be done with divisors that are non-linear, for simplicity’s sake, we will stick with linear factors.</p>
<p>Once again, let’s dive directly into an example, and then work our way through it. We’ll use the same example as in the previous section.</p>
<img src='polydiv3.png' width='250'>
<br>
<ul>
<li>If we divide by $x-a$, the number we write on the left-hand side is $a$ (which is why we put a $7$ there)
<ul>
<li>Formally, we set the divisor to $0$, so if we were dividing by $ax - b$, we’d use $\frac{b}{a}$ as this value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The top row represents the coefficients of the dividend $p(x)$ – the leftmost column is the highest degree term, the next column is the second highest degree term, etc.</li>
<li>The very bottom row represents the quotient and remainder
<ul>
<li>We know that by dividing a degree 2 polynomial by a degree 1, our result will be a polynomial of degree 1 and remainder will be a constant</li>
<li>The rightmost number is the remainder, $20$, whereas the two terms to the left represent the quotient $x + 2$</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The process is iterative - we add downwards, and multiply numbers in the bottom row by $a$ ($7$) to create numbers in the middle row.</p>
<ul>
<li>We always bring down the leading coefficient.</li>
<li>The $7$ in the middle row is the result of multiplying $7 \times 1$</li>
<li>The $2$ in the bottom row is the result of adding $-5 + 7$</li>
<li>The $14$ in the middle row is the result of multiplying $7 \times 2$</li>
<li>The $20$ in the bottom row is the result of adding $6 + 14$</li>
</ul>
<p>Another example:</p>
<div align=center>
<img src='polydiv4.png' width='350'>
</div>
<br>
<p>Here, we divided $p(x) = x^4 + 3x^2 - 11x - 3$ by $x-4$ to yield the quotient $q(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + 19x + 65$ with remainder $r(x) = 257$.</p>
<br>
<a name='factrem'>
<h2>Remainder and Factor Theorems</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<p>Now, we’re equipped to do some analysis regarding the division algorithm.</p>
<a name = 'remainder'>
<h3>Remainder Theorem</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<p>Suppose we’re dividing some arbitrary polynomial $p(x)$ by linear divisor $x-a$. Then, we can say $p(x) = (x-a)q(x) + r(x)$.</p>
<p>What happens if we evaluate $p(a)$? Well, the first term cancels out since $a - a = 0$, and we’re left with $r(a)$. This result is known as the <strong>remainder theorem</strong>.</p>
<p>Formally, the remainder theorem states that <strong>if $p(x)$ is a polynomial, such that $r(x)$ is the remainder that results from dividing $p(x)$ by $x - a$, then $p(a) = r(a)$</strong>. (Notice that this only applies to polynomial divisions with linear divisors.)</p>
<p>As a sanity check: When introducing polynomial division, we showed that $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-7)(x+2) + 20$, meaning that the remainder when dividing $x^2 - 5x + 6$ by $x - 7$ was $20$. We can also easily verify that $p(7) = 7^2 - 5 \cdot 7 + 6 = 49 - 35 + 6 = 20$.</p>
<br>
<a name='factor'>
<h3>Factor Theorem</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<p>What if we had that $r(x) = 0$? Then, we’d write $p(x) = (x-a)q(x)$, meaning that $x-a$ evenly divided $p(x)$, i.e. that $x-a$ was a <strong>factor</strong> of $p(x)$. This leads to the <strong>factor theorem</strong>, which is a more specific case of the remainder theorem.</p>
<p><strong>Specifically, the factor theorem states that $x-a$ is a factor of $p(x)$ if and only if $p(a) = 0$.</strong></p>
<p>Clearly, $x - 7$ is not a factor of $p(x) = x^2 - 5x + 6$, since the remainder is 20 (or, equivalently, $p(7) = 20 \neq 0$). However, $x - 3$ is a factor of $p(x)$, as $x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x-3) (x-2) + 0$ (or, equivalently, $p(3) = 0$). As another example, since we can factor $p(x) = x^3 + 7x^2 + 6x$ into $p(x) = x(x + 1)(x + 6)$, we know that $p(0) = p(-1) = p(-6) = 0$.</p>
<p>We now have all of the tools necessary to formally discuss the nature of complex roots.</p>
<br>
<a name='roots'>
<h2>Roots</h2>
<hr>
</a>
<p>The final key property of polynomials determined by their degree are their number of roots. You may have learned before that a real-valued polynomial with real coefficients of degree $n$ has anywhere between 0 and $n$ roots, depending on its specifics. However, we can actually make a stronger claim.</p>
<p><strong>All real-valued polynomials with real coefficients of degree $n$ have exactly $n$ roots, with some possibly complex roots.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s disect this. The first class of polynomial we encounter with varying numbers of roots is the parabola, of degree $2$. You may have studied before that parabolas have one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2$ roots, meaning they intercept the $x$ axis twice</li>
<li>$1$ root, meaning they sit on the $x$ axis (this is actually known as a double root)</li>
<li>$0$ roots, meaning that they sit completely above or completely below the $x$ axis</li>
</ul>
<p>Recall, given a quadratic of the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, the solutions to $f(x) = 0$ are given by $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$.</p>
<p>The three cases above come from the three different states of the discriminant, $b^2 - 4ac$. When $b^2 - 4ac &gt; 0$, there are two distinct roots. When $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, the “plus-or-minus” term vanishes, leaving a double root at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. The case we’re now interested in is when $b^2 - 4ac &lt; 0$, where we would previously claim there to be “no solution” since we cannot take the square root of a negative number. In fact, there are still two perfectly valid solutions - they’re just not real numbers.</p>

<p>Complex numbers (look <strong><a href="../misc/complex-numbers.html">here</a></strong> for a refresher) are a superset of the real numbers. We can represent a complex number $z$ in <strong>rectangular form</strong> as $z = a + bi$, where $a, b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit defined by $i^2 = -1$. We say $a$ is the “real part” and $bi$ is the “imaginary part.” We can represent the set of real numbers as complex numbers, with $b = 0$.</p>
<p>The simplest parabola that has complex roots is $p(x) = x^2 + 1$, which sits one unit above the $x$ axis, centered on the $y$ axis. It has roots $x_1 = i$ and $x_2 = -i$, respectively, which you can verify with the quadratic equation or by evaluating $p(x_1), p(x_2)$.</p>
<p>An important consequence of our new, stronger definition of the number of roots of a polynomial is that <strong>all polynomials are now completely factorable into linear terms</strong>, whereas previously this was not the case. Previously, we could factor $x^2 + 5x + 6$ and $x^2 - 16$ into $(x+2)(x+3)$ and $(x-4)(x+4)$, respectively, because we knew these polynomials in standard form had roots. However, now we can factor $x^2 + 1$ as well, into $(x-i)(x+i)$, by the factor theorem. In general,</p>

<p>$p(x) = \sum_{k = 0}^n a_kx^k = a(x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)…(x-r_{n-1})(x-r_n)$ $= a\prod_{i = 0}^n (x - r_i)$</p>
</div>
<p>where $a$ is some real constant and $r_1, r_2, … r_n$ represent the roots of $p(x)$. Remember, our polynomials still only take and return real numbers as inputs and outputs, and all coefficients are still real numbers. It’s just the roots that are potentially complex.</p>

<h3>Complex Root Pairs</h3>
<hr>
</a>
<p>As it turns out, complex roots always occur in pairs. No real polynomial can have only a single complex root, or three complex roots, or any odd number of complex roots. Furthermore:</p>
<div align=center>
<p>$f(a + bi) = 0 \implies f(a - bi) = 0$</p>
</div>
<p>This says that if a complex number is a root of a real polynomial, its <strong>complex conjugate</strong> must also be a root. Conjugates are defined exactly as above – the conjugate of $z = a + bi$ is $\bar{z} = a - bi$. Complex conjugates are defined this way for the following reason:</p>
<div align=center>
<p>$z\bar{z} = (a + bi)(a - bi) = a^2 - abi + bai - b^2i = a^2 - b^2i = a^2 + b^2$</p>
</div>
<p>When multiplying a complex number by its conjugate, the imaginary parts fall out and we’re left with a real number. In particular, this real number $z\bar{z} = |z|^2$ is the <strong>square of the magnitude</strong> of the complex number, i.e. the squared distance from $0$.</p>
<p>Let’s justify why $a + bi$ and $a - bi$ will always exist together as roots. By the factor theorem, if they are both roots of some $p(x)$ of degree $n$:</p>
<div align=center>
<p>$\begin{aligned} p(x) &amp;= (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)…(x - r_{n-2})\left[(x - (a + bi))(x - (a - bi))\right] \\ &amp;= (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)…(x - r_{n-2})\left[x^2 - ((a - bi) + (a + bi))x - (a+bi)(a-bi) \right] \\ &amp;= (x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)…(x - r_{n-2})\left[x^2 - 2ax - (a^2 + b^2) \right] \end{aligned} $</p>
</div>
<p>The product $(x - (a + bi))(x - (a - bi))$ yields a completely real polynomial. This real polynomial, multiplied by the rest of $(x - r_1)(x - r_2)…(x-r_{n-2})$, which is assumed to be real, will result in a real $p(x)$. However, if $(x - (a + bi))$ were multipled by $(x - (c + di))$, for any other complex number $c + di \neq a - bi$, the resulting last term of $p(x)$ would contain complex terms, meaning that $p(x)$ would have complex coefficients, going against our definition set in the beginning.</p>
<p>To show this, a good exercise is to multiply out $(x - (a + bi))(x - (c + di))$ and show that the only way for this product polynomial to be real is if $c = a$ and $d = -b$.</p>
